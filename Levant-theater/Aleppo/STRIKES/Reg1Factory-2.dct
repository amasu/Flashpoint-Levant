desc = [[Our spies have confirmed the existence an enemy vehicle depot east of Reyhanli, in a border post. The target warehouse is the largest building in the complex, and has a distinctive black roof. We cannot let the Syrian Army send more vehicles against our Turkish allies, so you are tasked with destroying it.

Primary objective: Destroy the warehouse.

Threats: AAA and MANPADS.

Recommended pilots: 2]]
