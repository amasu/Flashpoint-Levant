desc = [[During a bombing mission targeting enemy encampments near Idlib, coalition aircraft were attacked by heavy AAA fire and SA-8 systems. Two of the pilots managed to divert from the original mission and eliminated an air defense site west of the town, allowing our aircraft to escape safely, but a later recon flight identified another AAA site east of the town, with an SA-8 system still present. We cannot risk sending more attackers to the region until this site is cleared.

Primary objective: Destroy at least half of the AAA battery.

Secondary objective: Eliminate the SA-8.

Threats: AAA and an SA-8. SA-2s may be watching the region, and enemy CAP is also present.

Recommended pilots: 2]]
